# TODOs

Absent or partially implemented features:
* Users
  * Users can sign in, log in/out, but can't review nor rate attractions
* Reviews
  * Comments are linked to attraction, yet as said before, users can't write any yet.
* Tickets
  * A draft has been written (TODO) yet not implemented within the core project
* Map
